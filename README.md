# MIMO_OFDM

This project simulates a wireless communication system based on **MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output)** combined with **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)**. The goal is to analyze the systemâ€™s performance in multipath fading channels.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The implementation includes the following modules:

- Transmitter signal processing (modulation, IFFT, cyclic prefix insertion)
- Channel modeling (MIMO channel with optional AWGN noise)
- Receiver signal processing (cyclic prefix removal, FFT, MIMO equalization)
- BER (Bit Error Rate) calculation and performance evaluation
